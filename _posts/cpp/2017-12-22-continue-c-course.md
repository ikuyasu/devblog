I specifically wanted to learn more details of the memory allocation and so on because nobody seems to teach that with Javascript. This C course does a fine job as I expected. When the program declairs the variable (identiifer), the instructor creates a box labled with the name of the variable leaving some space to fill out for the value assigned later. 

I also like seeing that when a function is called, they create a box for the function with the function name and destorys it when it returns, indicating that the meomory allocated for this function is cleared. 

The problem is that it goes slow, verbose. I use 1.5x for all the videos, but the small snippe of readings slows down the progress.
