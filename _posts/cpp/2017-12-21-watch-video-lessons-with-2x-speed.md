This programming course is a series of three courses in Coursera provided by Duke University. I am trying to go through the first one *Programming Fundamentals* as quckliy as possible by increasing the video speed by 1.5x or so. This series starts the C programming in the 2nd course, but it's interesting to learn how they are taeachng coding with the emphasis of planning out the algorithems first. They have a 7 steps to write a code, basically consisting of planning before getting down to the coding. 

Coursera doesn't embed the video control by default. You need to enable it to move in the sequence of the video by the right click. I don't think it has a built-in video speed control, so you will have to install one of the Chrome extensions that does it, which is not a big deal though.
